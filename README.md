**Machine Learning for Antibiotic Discovery Assignment**

*3AB3 - Antibiotics*

Your goal is to preprocesses your training data. Then, train a random forest model using your processed data. You will then run predictions on a set of 2,925 molecules. You will be calculating how similar these molecules are to known antibiotics to identify novel antibiotics. Finally, you will provide a final set of molecules that you would prioritize to be tested in the lab based on what you have learned from this tutorial series.
